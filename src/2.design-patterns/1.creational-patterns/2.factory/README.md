# Factory Pattern (Factory Method & Abstract Factory)

- Factory is a component responsible solely for the "wholesale" creation of objects
- Wholesale object creation means a single statement should create the object, it is non-piecewise
- Object creation can be outsourced to
  - A seperate (static) method (Factory Method Pattern)
  - A seperate class (Factory Pattern)
  - A hierarchy of factories (Abstract Factory Pattern)
