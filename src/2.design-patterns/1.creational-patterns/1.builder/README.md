# Builder Creational Pattern

- Builder pattern provides any API for constructing objects step-by-step
- These objects are typically complex and hard to constrcuct just by using a single constructor call
- Builder pattern avoids needing to have a very large initializer (e.g. 10+ initializer argumetns)
- Instead, use a builder component construct the object piecewise
