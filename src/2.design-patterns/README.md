# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typically split into three categories -

## 1. Creatonal Patterns

- Deal with the creation/construction of objects
- Explicit (constructor) vs. Implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
- Wholesale (single statement) vs. Piecewise (step-by-step)

## 2. Structural Patterns

- Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
- Stress the importance of good API design

## 3. Behavioral Patterns

- Behavioral patterns have no central theme, they have minimal overlaps
